So let's assume for a second that you don't want to hire Text A Coder for some ridiculous reason!

You want to go ahead with hiring your own engineer. Congrats!

On the surface, finding an engineer appears to be straight-forward, you just browse through profiles on Upwork or Freelancer.com, right? Well, it's not that simple. I'm about to outline the pre-qualification steps that we use at Text A Coder.

This is part of our evolving playbook.

# Who We Are Looking For
While there are countless individuals offering software development services, no developer will care about your project more than you. It's just a fact of life. So what do you do when you have a marketplace filled with engineers who are just looking for quick cash?

Throw money at them of course!

Alright, that's probably not the best idea.

As it turns out, there are a large number of engineers who care more about the quality of their software more than just delivering a functional product for money. They are continuously learning the latest technologies and evolving their skill set.

These are the ones you are going after.

While it may cost you slightly more for passionate engineers, the result will be better software and a smoother running project.

So how do you go about finding these developers?

# Initial Test
The first step is simple pre-interview questions. Most of these questions will be insanely simple. For example, one of the tests I came up with took approximately 8 minutes for me to complete.

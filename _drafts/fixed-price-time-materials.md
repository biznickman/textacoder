excerpt: "When does fixed price make sense? When does time and materials?"

One of the original promises of Text A Coder is the ability to receive an almost instant quote. Instant quotes are an incredibly powerful service offering but there can be immense trade offs. To provide transparency on how we approach pricing for software development, I created this guide.

In it, I'll outline the pros and cons of various pricing models and describe when each is an ideal fit. First up is fixed price development.

### Fixed Price Software Development
Fixed price development is exactly what it sounds like: a flat, fixed price. Through conversation between the client and software developer, a price is determined based on a pre-determined scope of work.

#### The Upside Of Fixed Prices
Fixed pricing can result in a positive experience for both parties. Upfront payments (which are typical with fixed prices) can help the developer offset freelance and agency cash flow issues. The client is happy because they know exactly how much they are paying and can manage cash flow on their end as well.

#### A $300 Project
I'll provide an example of a common small fixed price project from when we started. One of our clients approached us with the need for a very small ReactJS web application. They happened to be a developer as well but had little experience with React. As they described at the time, "it's partly for me to show to my stakeholders, and partly to prove to myself that I wouldn't be building something in React/Angular that is not going to fit into a bigger framework".

After receiving a mockup from the client, I concluded that this was something that could be done in approximately three hours. Since it was a small task and I had a React JS developer available, I sent over a quote for $300 at a rate of $100 per hour.

As is usually case, [the estimate was off](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-software-development-task-estimations-regularly-off-by-a-factor-of-2-3/). It's the nature of software development. Software engineers like to think they can get a lot more done in the short-term than can actually be done.

So how long did this task take? Approximately 5 hours. The $100 per hour that was originally the target quickly got reduced to $60. That also doesn't include the 30 minutes to an hour of conversation that took place prior to the project beginning.

Thanks to fixed pricing, the return on time was reduced by more than 40 percent!

This type of situation tends to be the most likely outcome. In all instances someone ends up eating the cost thanks to our own inability to predict how long it takes to accomplish a task.

More often than not it's the software developer or agency who ends up suffering from this pricing structure.

#### Who Doesn't Fixed Pricing Work For
Fixed pricing works for nobody! (Just joking...)

However imagine a project that is estimated at $3,000 and then winds up taking $12,000 worth of development time. While this isn't a typical situation it's not unheard of. The end result is that both the client and the developer wind up unhappy. Why?

The developer (or agency) winds up unhappy because there's a chance they are going to miss rent one month due a lousy pricing estimate. The client is unhappy because the project is taking far longer than expected and communication between the two parties turns hostile.

Nobody at all wants to be in this position.

#### What Projects Fixed Price Is Best For
Ultimately fixed pricing isn't always a disaster though. The development shop or freelance developer, likely has a few extra hours available where they aren't generating any income. $50 per hour is greater than $0 no matter how you view it.

Additionally, the feeling that completing a project is always great for developers since most projects seem to linger on forever.

Fixed pricing should only be limited to very small projects though. At Text A Coder we do not allow for fixed pricing above $1,000. The reason is obvious.

### Time And Materials Based Pricing
Now that we've covered fixed pricing, let's talk about the pricing model us and many dev shops use for larger projects: time and materials. This is just as it sounds: the client gets billed for the amount of time a developer spends on a project and any additional expenses incurred through that development.

#### Common Components For Time And Materials
At Text A Coder we operate on a bi-weekly billing cycle. Simply put, we bill regardless of milestones as deliverable times can vary from one milestone to the next. However we perform weekly check-ins/standups as part of the agile development process.

The client knows what they are getting by the end of the week and then we can reflect on what was accomplished, any hurdles in the cycle, and proceed on to the next week. So how does payment operate for most people using this approach.

*Initial Payment*

Initial payments vary from one project to the next, however there should always be a deposit. This deposit is essentially nothing more than confirmation the client has the ability to pay while simultaneously triggering the start of a project.

*Weekly Payments*

This cycle varies from one dev-shop to the next, but to offset cash-flow issues which are all to common in the world of contract software development, regularly scheduled payments are critical. Many developers will provide a discount as a reward for on time payments.

*Milestone Payments*

Another approach to payments is making them at the time of milestone completion. Many clients prefer this approach because it reduces their risk that projects won't be completed despite making payments. This works unless milestones are months apart.

No developer is happy going months without payment.

#### What Projects Do Time And Materials Work For
I'd love to say every project should be billed based on Time and Materials! Unfortunately some clients have a strict budget that they can't deviate from. For that reason, our number one cause of turning down projects is budgets that are too low.

Aside from small projects, we recommend using Time and Materials for pretty much every project. If a client can't afford a set hourly or weekly rate, there's potentially space for negotiation here.

#### Where Don't Time And Materials Work
The only time this billing approach doesn't work is when a client isn't willing to use it. Many people don't have $100 to change the text and color of a button on their website despite it taking an hour to do so.

In that case they'll go spend hours looking for a developer to complete a task, manage them, and then "spend less".

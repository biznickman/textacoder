Hey {{subscriber.first_name}},

Hello again! As you recall, in my prior email I explained how to quickly filter out unqualified developers. The market is flooded with these and they will only cause you pain.

Fortunately, you have now saved yourself a ton of pain.

Now it's time to find those engineers within your remaining batch that are going to make your product development process enjoyable.

During this phase you want to learn more beyond their coding abilities. At this stage you want to find out their personality and how passionate they are for software development.

On paper, many developers sound incredibly promising. They may even breeze through your coding tests. Unfortunately, while you've weeded out weaker candidates there are still less talented ones in the candidate pool.

I remember interviewing an engineer who received a PHD in computer science from Stanford University. On paper he was incredible! Not only did he graduate from a stellar university but he had also won some nationally recognized awards.

While his coding skills weren't bad, he was impossible to communicate with. He also appeared to be overqualified for what I was looking for.

In person or over the phone interviews are critical for uncovering these subtle things. So what are you looking to identify during these second-stage interviews? Here are a few questions I'm looking to have answered.

**What projects has the developer worked on?**
I love seeing the projects that developers have worked on. While I hate to be biased in the hiring process, it's kind of a warning flag for me if the engineer has never worked on a project that they can be proud about.

More importantly, if I'm not impressed by any of the developer's projects, it's a huge warning flag.

**What sites do they read on a regular basis? This can include e-mail newsletters.**
To be fair, developers learn the most through coding, not through reading news. Despite this, it's absolutely critical to read newsletters and articles to identify the latest best practices and technologies.

Imagine hiring a developer who wants to custom develop an image management system because they weren't aware of tools like [Cloudinary](https://www.cloudinary.com) or [Imgix](https://www.imgix.com/).

If I'm hiring a Javascript developer, I want them to be reading [Javascript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/) and possibly [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) (which isn't as insightful).

**What's a coding book that they remember?**
Again, most developers I know rarely read software development books. In addition to most information being available online, most insight can be gained from shorter posts. However most developers can tell you at least one book they remember reading.

I like to think of [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U9MI0u2VIE) from the movie Hackers. You likely don't remember the reference but the developer being tested (main character) was able to say what each book was about.

For me, I remember the [purple PHP book](https://www.amazon.com/PHP-MySQL-Development-Developers-Library/dp/0321833899/) and the [Dietel and Dietel C++ book](https://www.amazon.com/How-Program-4th-Harvey-Deitel/dp/0130384747/). I honestly haven't read many software development books since then but I can remember!

**What events have they been to?**
While not much programming gets done at conferences, a developer who attends events tends to be on top of the latest programming trends. Especially since software development is always changing.

I don't want a developer to be away from their desk all the time, but I most definitely want them to be improving all the time. Attending events is a critical part of this.

**What was a situation in which they learned a ton about coding? Was there an individual or a course they took that enabled them to level-up their skills?**
Learning skills is all about practice. As we progress through our training journey we hit new plateaus where we remain prior to leveling up again. In software development, these "level up" moments typically come from an external source.

Whether it's a course we took, a book we read, or often times a mentor, we periodically have break-throughs. If a developer can't remember a single time where they had a paradigm shift in how they code, it's a major warning flag for me.

# Get To Work!
By now you should have brought your developers through the entire hiring process. Hopefully one or two engineers stand out to you and you are ready to get them working.

To kick things off I like to start developers on small tasks and ease them in. Working with them is the only way for me to learn how they work and code.

Even if you happen to be working on a large project, it's possible to break things down into smaller pieces. For example, have the developer create a login page and see how they go about doing it!

So now that you've hired your engineer, how do you ensure things run smoothly? In my next e-mail I'll share with you one of the more important aspects: protecting your project.

Until next time,
Nick

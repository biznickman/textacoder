So let's assume for a second that you don't want to hire Text A Coder for some ridiculous reason!

Let's also assume that Zapier isn't going to cut it for you and you need something custom or more robust.

You want to go ahead with hiring your own engineer. Congrats!

On the surface, finding an engineer appears to be straight-forward, you just browse through profiles on Upwork or Freelancer.com, right? Well, it's not that simple. I'm about to outline the pre-qualification steps that we use at Text A Coder.

This is part of our evolving playbook.

While there are countless individuals offering software development services, no developer will care about your project more than you. It's just a fact of life. So what do you do when you have a marketplace filled with engineers who are just looking for quick cash?

Throw money at them of course!

Alright, that's probably not the best idea.

As it turns out, there are a large number of engineers who care more about the quality of their software more than just delivering a functional product for money. They are continuously learning the latest technologies and evolving their skill set.

These are the ones you are going after.

While it may cost you slightly more for passionate engineers, the result will be better software and a smooth running project.

Ok, so how are we going to find these developers?

# Give A Pre-Interview Test
A few simple questions can go a long way to quickly filter out unqualified developers. For example, I once tried out Upwork to find an engineer and here's what I got back for my interview questions:

![Bad interview questions](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.textacoder.com/img/flawless-development/hiring/1-bad-questions.png)

You think I hired this guy? Of course not! He may have years of experience but he was horrible at communication.

I can already picture him calling me an idiot for some product decision I make. Not going to be a good experience!

To be fair, the guy was right. The questions were simple. However that's the point of the questions! They are supposed to be quick to answer and verify that the developer has a basic skill level.

You will be surprised by how many developers can't answer a basic question.

So how do you handle these initial tests?

There are a few resources. The first two come up with the questions and the answers but you'll need to pay for them. [Codility](https://codility.com/) charges $159 per month for a single user account and you need to pay 6-months up front. [Testdome](https://www.testdome.com/) charges on a per candidate basis. $4 per candidate for 15-minute tests and $20 per candidate for longer tests.

Both of these can become costly very quickly. For example, I had 200 developers apply to work for TextACoder in the past two-weeks and 50 of them completed initial tests.

I avoided the fees by using a product called [InterviewZen](https://www.interviewzen.com/). The only downside of InterviewZen is that you will need to come up with the questions yourself and you'll need to manually review the code.

If you don't know how to read code, I recommend using one of the first two tools as it will easily be worth it.

Congrats! You've now made it through the first step of the developer hiring process. In my next email I'll be explaining the next phase of the hiring process.

Until tomorrow,
Nick

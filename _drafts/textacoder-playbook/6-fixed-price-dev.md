*Bzzzzzzzz*

John's phone was vibrating again with a text message from a new prospect.

> "I'm trying to build out a Facebook like messenger UI but with a few minor differences"

"Here we go again!", John thought to himself. He was used to getting incomplete requests from clients like Mary. Mary had little technical experience but that wouldn't hold her back from her dream. This MVP would be her first step toward world domination and the official launch of her startup.

John shot back a message to Mary, "Can we hop on a call real quick so I can get a clear picture of what you have in mind? I'm (415) 555-1212".

Mary began explaining the details of her product. Some initial code had already been done but she needed additional features after Chuck, the prior developer, disappeared. Not even Mary could tell you what had happened to Chuck. Out of nowhere he had become non-responsive. Perhaps he was galavanting around the southern Pacific thanks to his flexible freelance lifestyle!

Unfortunately none of this was of use to Mary as she was on a hard deadline.

As Mary began listing off features John was quick to ask clarifying questions. "Do you want to keep the existing design or have a new one?" Mary replied, "The existing one is fine."

"Who are these conversations between?", John asked. "Two or more people."

"Ah, so you are looking for group texting?"

"Yep!"

On and on the conversation went until John had a good idea of the requirements. Mary was growing impatient with all the questions, especially in instances where she didn't know exactly the outcome. Typically, John wouldn't work with these types of clients because they are doomed from the start. No fixed budget and no clearly defined specification is a recipe for disaster.

However John had some available time to work on a new project so he decided to cater to Mary's desires, one of which was a flat quote.

John took into consideration all of Mary's requirements and came back with an answer, "I think this is going to cost $5,000 to get done".

After consulting her stakeholders Mary came back to John with the approval. A deposit was made and development began.

### Coding Begins
John was super anxious about this project as he knew the project was on shaky ground from the start. So he decided to get ahead of the problem and began creating a specification with all the milestones that Mary could sign off on. He sent over the milestones to Mary and got approval.

Off he went coding away. He knew if the project took any longer than 50 hours he'd be losing money. John spent the first day reviewing Chuck's old code. As usual, the code was poorly written. Chuck didn't really care much about Mary so he churned out the quickest deliverable he could right before disappearing.

Fortunately John was able to figure out how things were created and proceeded with development. After the first day he had familiarized himself with the code and had made progress on creating the database models.

The next day, creation of the database began so chat messages could be stored. Then a hiccup occurred. One of the libraries the last developer had chosen to use was making it so the new code John had written wasn't working. The database library had a bug and what would typically be a simple query was now taking forever.

An entire day of development was lost before John was able to workaround the bug. 16 hours in and some basic functionality had been created. Hopefully things would run smoother the next day!

Day after day some issue would arise and John would figure out a solution. That's what development is all about! However after working through the weekend it became clear that John would miss his estimate.

By the time the project was over, John had spent 90 hours on the project that was supposed to take 50.

Mary also had some "small changes" that she wanted to make as part of that initial budget. Unfortunately there was no time left in the project as he explained to Mary. "But you quoted me $5,000 for getting this delivered!"

"Yeah well that was before the feature creep and the bugs we ran into with the old code."

Mary was caught between a rock and a hard place. She had a budget for the project, and an ideal deliverable in her mind. Unfortunately things were not going as planned.

John was also getting frustrated with the project because he had gone far over his expected time. He knew the overtime was coming but had now hit his limit.

You can see where this story is going at this point. It's the standard case of a fixed-price software development project going awry.

There are so many outcomes that typically happen at this point in the story. One of the most common is that the developer just quits.

If they don't quit and have a greater tolerance, they'll at a minimum become hostile to the client. Funny enough, it's not either person's fault that things implode.

It's just the nature of large fixed-price projects.

The only situation in which both people are actually happy about the project is when the developer over-estimated the project. Developers and agencies love making $300+ an hour. Who wouldn't?!?

However most smaller clients do not want to pay this much.

If you are reading this email series than there's a very good chance that you are in the same boat. You don't want to overpay but you also want to make sure your project runs smoothly.

In my next email I'll jump into the pricing and project management system we use at TextACoder. We find that this system is one that makes both ourselves and clients happy.

Until next time!

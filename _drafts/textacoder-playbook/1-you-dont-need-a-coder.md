When Troy answered my call his only intention was to find out how much it would cost to add a feature to his soon-to-launch company.

The product, a happy hour recommendation system, was a perfect fit for him as he was a bartender at a local pub. Selling the product to other pubs would be incredibly simple as he had a deep understanding of the market. However months into the product-development, Troy and his co-founder still had a ton of work to do.

After listening to the state of his business, I quickly realized he wouldn't be a good fit for Text A Coder. In addition to not having the budget for outsourced development, it was obvious to me that he didn't even need much of the site. In fact, he didn't even need a developer!

One of the greatest mistakes that many entrepreneurs make at the outset of their business is that they over-build. The system that was intended to become a solution to a clearly defined problem, instead becomes a work of art.

Feature after feature is tacked on to solve a perceived problem that was discovered during the development process (without customer input). Projects like these rarely see the light of day. For the few that do make it, they are often shut down soon after due to a plethora of reasons.

It turns out that you can avoid the fate that these startups and projects have experienced. How?

In the coming emails I'm opening the entire kimono on how we generated over $30,000 in two weeks our own business with a single webpage, how we hire engineers, and how we ensure software development projects run flawlessly.

Through these emails you can leverage our own lessons to ensure your next product feature or business idea experiences the success it deserves!

Before we jump in to all the details though, I want to show you a simple tool that I shared with Troy (the entrepreneur I told you about earlier in this email) to launch without any development time.

This software is deeply integrated to our workflow at Text A Coder and my guess is that it will be integrated into your business too.

Iâ€™ll be sending you an email tomorrow with all the details so stay tuned! In the meantime, reply to this email and let me know what project you are currently working on or want to accomplish!

Until tomorrow,
Nick

P.S. I know I left you hanging but I swear the wait until tomorrow will be worth it!

P.P.S. You may be wondering, who the heck is this Nick O'Neill character?!? Why should I be listening to him? I put together [this page](https://www.textacoder.com/nick-oneill) so you can learn more about my past if you are super curious :)

"Time And Materials"

That's the term that Google says we use to describe our billing practice at TextACoder. Personally, I hate the term because it implies that there's a cost of materials for creating a digital product.

To be fair, there are definitely fees for hosting resources but that's about it!

Anyways, in my last email I went over the issues that we run into when using fixed-price consulting. Today I want to bring you through the approach we use at TextACoder but first I want to describe the fear.

For me, the fear is best described by the comedian Dane Cook who describes the experience of going to an auto-mechanic.

> With any auto-mechanic you've ever dealt with, no matter what he says, in your head you're thinking "This guy is screwing me big time!"

> Whatever they say, you just keep nodding.

> "Uh, by the way we had to replace the roof of your car. It was peeling away in resentment of the rest of the car."

> "And also we found a tiny unicorn in your exhaust and it was hopping around and poking random holes in your exhaust. And he was crapping in your filters as well. So we had to replace that entire unit."

> And you reply, "Oh, ok thank you very much. Yeah, I didn't know that the roof was so angry at the rest of the vehicle."

> "And good God, I'm glad you found that tiny mythological creature in there. I can't have holes being poked, especially with a road trip coming up!"

> "How much is that going to cost me? $7,000? Yeah that's what I was going to suggest."

You get the point. Software development should not be the same way but we often feel that it is. Did it really take 4 hours to change the color of that link?!?

Why is it costing us so much to change the text on this page?

I've been in your shoes. Years ago I built a startup for which the iPhone app was the core. The development team I hired for the mobile app never finished the product. Unfortunately I had already paid them over $20,000.

When it came to iOS development I had no idea how to determine whether or not the amount of time the developer said he was spending was accurate.

Eventually I ended up taking a course on building iOS apps and finished it myself, but that's a different story!

Once I was able to read the code, I realized that it was poorly written. I had thrown money away at a poorly developed app!

The reality is that trust is required to ensure periodic pricing (hourly, daily, weekly, etc) is effective. That trust is built over the course of many iterations.

At TextACoder, this iterative trust growth is a core reason for implementing [agile development](http://agilemethodology.org/) practices.

I'm not going to outline the entire process in this email. However I suggest you look it up if you haven't heard of it.

Every week (or two) we deliver code to the client which they have a chance to review. That enables the client to determine whether or not they are satisfied with the existing deliverables and pricing.

At this point the car-mechanic metaphor is useless because you can't iteratively fix your car. It either works or it doesn't!

However it alleviates a lot of the fear that we encounter when starting a new software development project.

"But Nick, I can't read code. What do I do?!? How do I ensure the developer is giving us a solid deliverable?"

Glad you asked!

You can't!

Was this one big ruse to convince you to work with TextACoder?!! Yes, it was! Ha ha!

To be honest, you are kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place when managing developers if you can't code. That's why so many non-technical clients try to go for fixed-price development.

However there's a secret weapon that you need in your arsenal: another developer.

Wait, but I'm hiring a developer, aren't I?! Yes, you are.

However my guess is that there's another developer that you personally know. The only problem is that either: (a) you can't afford them, or (b) they are already employed.

Find that developer and tell them you want them to review the code of the developer that you hire.

At TextACoder we spend 1 hour on every 5 to 10 hours of coding time reviewing the developer's code. At top agencies, like PivotalLabs, they invest 1 hour for code review for every 1 hour of development.

That's because there are two developers working simultaneously using a practice called [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming).

Internally, I require that all code by our developers are submitted via *pull requests*. Another developer (or technical project manager) must then review the code before it's merged into the client's code base.

All of this is done in Github, the service I mentioned a couple emails ago.

While this process increases the cost of development by 10% to 20%, it improves the quality of the code dramatically.

Alright, now you have the high-level overview of the TextACoder playbook! If you want to ensure you have a smooth running software development project, just follow the steps I outlined in these emails.

If you ever have a question about your software development project, just shoot us a text!

Thanks again for taking the time to read our playbook!

I hope you don't mind but I may periodically send you additional strategies for flawless software product development. I promise not to send you more than one email (or rarely two) in a week.

In the meantime, I hope you have a great rest of your week!

Talk soon,
Nick

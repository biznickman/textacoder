Sorry for keeping you hanging yesterday. I swear I'll ~never~ do it again ;)

So as it turns out, you likely don't actually need a developer. That's right!

You may be thinking, "Nick, why on earth would you tell me that I don't need a developer when you sell software development services?!?!? Are you an idiot?!?!"

I'll be completely honest. I hate wasting my time on customers who don't need our services. It's such a time suck that I wrote this email to avoid having unnecessary phone calls! Yeah, this e-mail is completely self-serving. Sorry!

Anyways, it's time for you to benefit from my self-centeredness.

If you have never heard of [Zapier](https://zapier.com), it's about time that you do. It's a product that I cannot possibly overstate the value of. With a few clicks you can quickly connect any of the disparate software services you currently subscribe to.

# How Zapier Works
At the core, Zapier enables you to simply say "If [something occurs within one of my company's systems], then [do something else]". The first part of this is something called a "Trigger".

As the image below illustrates, you can select from over 500 applications to trigger your "Zapier recipe".

The second part is something called an "Action". You can have multiple actions taken after a trigger happens. While most of my recipes typically involve only two applications, you can chain together actions. In the image below I illustrate a single trigger and a single action.

Every time someone fills out a form I have on my website (that I embedded with [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com)), I send myself a push notification on my phone (using an app called [Pushover](https://pushover.net/)).

That's all there is to it!

# A Couple Examples
So what are some other uses of Zapier? While I'll be sharing more over the coming days and weeks, here are a couple of recipes that I've used.

## Lead Management
One of our clients, [Kugamon](https://www.kugamon.com), hired us to clean up their homepage. Prior to our overhaul it honestly looked like a website from the 90s. I'm not sure if you remember Geocities, but their website could have been deemed a "classic".

Anyways, since I didn't know how they wanted to handle leads that came from their website, I set up something called a Zapier Web Hook. I'll spare you all the technical details but when someone fills out a form on the Kugamon website, it makes a request to Zapier with all the details.

From there, Zapier enabled Kugamon to send an instant follow-up email using Gmail while simultaneously adding the lead to Salesforce. The team at Kugamon was able to put together this system in a matter of minutes with little help from me.

In the future, should they want to change how website leads flow through their system, they can change the funnel without needing to hire a developer.

## Meetup Marketing
[Meetup](https://www.meetup.com) is a website that enables communities with shared interests to connect in person. A few months ago I decided to organize my own meetup to connect technically-minded marketers. I knew that Meetup messages often go unnoticed and wanted a way to collect the emails of members as they registered to join the group.

As members join the meetup they are prompted with a number of questions, one of which prompts them for their email address. Zapier enabled me to track those responses and funnel them to my [Drip](http://mbsy.co/7gwCs) email list without any programming.

Whenever I want to announce new events, I send them out first to my email list. It also enables me to have a direct relationship with my members without having to go through Meetup.

# You Don't Need To Code
So now I've shared with you my secret tool for avoiding software development. While you can integrate code into your Zapier recipes, you can accomplish A TON without writing a single line of code.

At this point you may be thinking to yourself, "Wow Nick, do you have any other secrets to prevent me from hiring you?" In fact I do! If for some horrible reason you'd rather hire a developer directly rather than go through Text A Coder, I'm about to reveal our playbook for hiring an engineer.

That will come over the next couple of emails.

In the meantime, I'd like to present you with another piece of educational content. I present to you this (completely unrelated) video about the [History of Japan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh5LY4Mz15o).

Talk soon,
Nick
